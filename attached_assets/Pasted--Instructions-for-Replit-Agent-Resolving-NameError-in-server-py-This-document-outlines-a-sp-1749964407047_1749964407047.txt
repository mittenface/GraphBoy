# Instructions for Replit Agent: Resolving `NameError` in `server.py`

This document outlines a specific issue previously identified in `server.py` and the steps to resolve it.

## Issue: `NameError: name 'logging' is not defined`

**Context:**
The WebSocket server was failing during the opening handshake. Console logs indicated the following repeating error:

```
opening handshake failed
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/runner/workspace/.pythonlibs/lib/python3.12/site-packages/websockets/asyncio/server.py", line 356, in conn_handler
    await connection.handshake(
  File "/home/runner/workspace/.pythonlibs/lib/python3.12/site-packages/websockets/asyncio/server.py", line 207, in handshake
    raise self.protocol.handshake_exc
  File "/home/runner/workspace/.pythonlibs/lib/python3.12/site-packages/websockets/asyncio/server.py", line 149, in handshake
    response = await response
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/home/runner/workspace/server.py", line 35, in process_request_hook  # Line number may vary slightly
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
             ^^^^^^^
NameError: name 'logging' is not defined. Did you forget to import 'logging'
```

This error occurred because the `process_request_hook` function in `server.py` attempted to use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` without the `logging` module being imported in that file.

## Action for Replit Agent:

To resolve the `NameError` and ensure the WebSocket handshake can proceed without this specific crash, please perform the following modification to the `server.py` file:

1.  **Ensure `server.py` is being edited.**
2.  **Add the following import statement at the beginning of the `server.py` file, typically grouped with other standard library imports:**

    ```python
    import logging
    ```

**Example of where to add the import:**

```python
import http.server
import socketserver
import json
from urllib.parse import urlparse
import asyncio
import websockets
import threading
import functools
from pathlib import Path
import logging  # <--- ADD THIS LINE HERE

from backend.component_registry import ComponentRegistry
# ... rest of the file
```

This will make the `logging` module and its functions available for use within `server.py`, specifically resolving the `NameError` in the `process_request_hook`.

**Note:** This change addresses the `NameError` specifically. Other configurations related to Replit's proxy behavior and dual HTTP/WebSocket server setup should be handled as per previous discussions or Replit Agent's broader recommendations for the application structure.
