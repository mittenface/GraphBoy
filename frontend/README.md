# Frontend Canvas Setup

This frontend uses HTML, JavaScript, and the Konva.js library to provide a canvas for drawing.

## Setup

The Konva.js library is included via a CDN in `public/index.html`.
The main JavaScript for initializing and drawing on the canvas is in `frontend/main.js`.
The main HTML page is `public/index.html`.

## Running the Example

To see the canvas in action with a sample rectangle:
1. Ensure you have a web browser.
2. Open the `public/index.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., by double-clicking it or using "File > Open" in your browser).

You should see a green rectangle drawn on a white background.
