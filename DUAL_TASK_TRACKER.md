# Dual Agent Synchronized Task Tracker

## Purpose & How to Use

This file tracks tasks for two agents or workstreams, referred to as **Agent A** and **Agent B**. The primary goal is to ensure that development proceeds in synchronized steps.

**Synchronization Rule:**
Tasks are processed in pairs. **Task N for Agent A** (e.g., the 3rd item in Agent A's list) and **Task N for Agent B** (e.g., the 3rd item in Agent B's list) must BOTH be completed before **Task N+1** for either agent can begin.

**Workflow:**
1.  **Add Tasks:** Add new tasks to the bottom of the relevant agent's list. Ensure a corresponding task (even if a placeholder) is added for the other agent to maintain pairing.
2.  **Check Prerequisites:** Before starting Task N, ensure Task N-1 is marked `[x]` for BOTH Agent A and Agent B. (Task 1 has no prerequisites).
3.  **Perform Task:** The assigned agent/person completes the work for their task.
4.  **Mark Complete:** Upon completion, edit this file and change the task's checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
5.  **Commit Changes:** Commit and push the updated file to the repository.
6.  **Advance to Next Pair:** Once Task N for both agents is `[x]`, work on Task N+1 can begin for both.
